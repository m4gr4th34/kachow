Universal Basic Income, by utilizing blockchain technology.

Whitepaper Version 001

The purpose of Universal Basic Income (UBI) is that it should redistribute wealth.  There is no need to cap the total amount of coins, because the USD has had no cap for 50+ years without any practical issue.  It has been shown that it is possible to survive on $1 per meal.  Therefore every day, every wallet will receive 1*3 = 3 Kachow Coin (KCoin), to provide a living wage, to initially drive a roughly on-parity exchange rate between KCoin and USD.  The US central bank prints money on a regular basis, deflating the USD, without destabilizing the USD over the past 50 years; the issue is that the newly printed USD is typically distributed to influential institutions, thus wealth is not distributed.  We propose that this ‘top heavy’ economy results in heavy, steady crashes that need sensational stimulus packages.  

With Kachow wallet, the new KCoins are distributed to everyone, creating a ‘circular’ economy that should result in less predatory behavior and ideally avoid all major crashes and economic depressions.  Redistribution of wealth occurs through deflating the value of the KCoins by regular printing.  On a regular basis, the KCoin will be replaced by a new ‘version’ of the KCoin (determined via algorithm) that simply divides the value of the previous version by a factor of 10.  Hence, if the price of bread increased in KCoin-V2 to a value of 10 KCoin-V2, it would suddenly cost 1KCoin-V3.  This way deflation redistributes the wealth regularly, without leading to an accumulation of endless zeros in coinage.

Demo:  
1. Person A starts with 0 KCoins, Person B starts with 1,000,000 KCoins.
2. Everyone receives 100 KCoins over a period of X days through UBI, so the balance is: Person A (100 KCoins), Person B (1,000,100 KCoins)
3. KCoin is undergoes an upgrade to Version 2, in order to 'reflate' the currency, by dividing KCoin Version 1 by 100.  I.e. KCoin-V2 = KCoin-V1 / 100
4. The balance in the wallets are now: Person A (1 KCoinV2), Person B (10,001 KCoinV2)
5. Continuing the process on a regular basis, one case see that every wallet tends towards 1 KCoin over time.

From a psychological point of view, everyone feels fair because everyone receives exactly the same UBI income.  Additionally no tax collection is required in order to perform the wealth redistribution.

The wallets should be attached to a biometric ID to ensure that duplicate UBI does not occur.

Investors receive a return on investment (ROI) through the initial KCoins that they receive, which should increase in value as the currency acquires adoption.  The investment will be used to create a mining company called Kachow Mining Inc which will mine KCoins in exchange for keeping the KCoin blockchain current.  The amount of KCoin generated for mining will alo depend on an algorithm that is linked to the valuation of KCoin in the marketplace, to maintain incentives for miners.  Other miners will also be encouranged to enter the space, leading to ‘decentralization’ of the KCoin.
